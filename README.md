# Co-op Rhythm Game

This is a simple rhythm game you can download and play with a friend!

To run, download the latest release from the releases tab. Run it as an exe (windows may prompt that it's a virus, you can safely override this).

To play, select a song from the menu. When the telephone poles reach the bottom bar, hit the corresponding keys on the keyboard. It is recommended that one player use the asdf keys and the other player use the jkl; keys.

You can play cooperatively or competitively. Have fun!
